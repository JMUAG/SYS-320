    "From what I can interpret, it looks like the firewall (proxy in this case) is taking a look at the activity and realied that the QQ.exe was involved in some traffic with the user via HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443). There was data transferred as well and the proxy made sure to take note of it. There are also signs of large byte numbers from what looks like being taken awayfrom the user accross these ports. It looks as of the attacker was operating on port 5070 from their device. Lastly, this wasn't in the prompt, but I can see that the qq domain has been utilized through other applications such as Wechat and it may be apart of a greater issue I don't fully comprehend yet."

    "Essentially, I enjoyed utilizing these features today because I was able to understand how I woulduse python in more of a real-world - personal application sense. When I usually go over python, it is to make video games or small coding assignments butI feel as if I am doing a lot with a little while also being able to comprehend most of the information that is present. One thing I need to workon tho is my effiency because it took me some time to get back in the groove with what we were taught and how I can apply the class material into a homework setting. That is just me personally, but I am honestly enjoying this class very much and you are doing such a great job! Thanks for the oppurtunity."
