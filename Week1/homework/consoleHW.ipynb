Essentially, your user or the users that you allowed to use SSH with your system should be the only usernames that pop up. The username is important because it is one of the key identifiers for a device with an established network connection, so if someone were top be intruding or invading your security - you would be able to see it because the logs are logging any username that is present via SSH.

    "What I enjoyed about this lab was the ability to get my brain right back into the python mentality and workspace while not having to relearn any of the tedius commands that we learned prior. I enjoyed the fact that we were held to a standard to understand and comprehend a certain amount of python, and I love that fact that I was able to meet those expectations. I didn't really have any questions or concerns or dislikes toward this lab, but I one thing that I will say is that the wording of some of these prompts confused me and my colleague due to the fact that we both thought that the prompt was expecting different outputs, but sometimes you just gotta go with your gut."
